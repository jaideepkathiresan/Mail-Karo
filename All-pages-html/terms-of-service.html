            The Service generates content based on your prompts using third-party AI

            outputs, and technical data may be processed by these third parties as
            described in our Privacy Policy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Third-party services are subject to their own terms and policies. We do not
            control and are not responsible for their content, practices, or security, but
